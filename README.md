Accepted at the 41st European Conference on Information Retrieval (ECIR), 2019.

This paper focussed on the comparison of summarization algorithms on Indian legal case judgements.

Types of algorithms:

* Supervised & Unsupervised, domain-specific (Extractive)
* Neural Networks based (Extractive and Abstractive)

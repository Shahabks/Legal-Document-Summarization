But under the Income tax Act the position is somewhat different It appears that a fresh partnership deed was drawn up in the year 1945 when Gilbert was brought in The appeal therefore fails and is dismissed with costs In 1924 Mathews went out and his share was taken over by Figgies and Notley The Tribunal in spite of this document took the view that under the Partnership Act a firm could be carried on even if there was a change in its constitution The High Court refused to look into this document as it had not been relied upon before the Tribunal and no reference bad been specifically made to it in the order of the Income tax Officer or the Assistant Commissioner It is true that under the law of partnership a firm has no legal existence apart from its partners and it is merely a compendious name to describe its partners but it is also equally true that under that law there is no dissolution of the firm by the mere incoming or outgoing of partners Reference was made by Mr Daphtary to the partnership deed drawn up in 1 It was argued that a different firm was then constituted The true question to decide is one of identity of the unit assessed under the Income tax Act 1918 which paid double tax in the year 1939 with the unit to whose business the private limited company succeeded in the year 1 We have no doubt that the Tribunal and the High Court were right in holding that in spite of the mere changes in the constitution of the firm the business of the firm as originally constituted continued as tea brokers right from its inception till the time it was succeeded by the limited company and that it was the same unit all through carrying on the same business at the same place and there was no cesser of that business or any change in the unit The assessee is a partnership concern It upheld the view taken by the Tribunal A firm can be charged as a distinct assessable entity as distinct from its partners who can also be assessed individually Sections 26 48 and 55 of the Act fully bear out this position In 1939 Hillman was brought in and the partnership consisted of these three partners The Income tax Officer disallowed the claim of the assessee on the ground that the partners of the firm in 1939 being different from the partners of the firm in 1947 no relief could be given to the applicant Section 3 which is the charging section is in these terms Where any Central Act enacts that income tax shall be charged for any year at any rate or rates tax at that rate or those rates shall be charged for that year in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this Act in respect of the total income of the previous year of every individual Hindu undivided family company and local authority and of every firm and other association of persons or the partners of the firm or the members of the association individually The partners of the firm are distinct assessable entities while the firm as such is a separate and distinct unit for purposes of assessment The result is that we see no substantial grounds for disturbing the opinion given by the High Court on the question submitted to it The law with respect to retiring partners as enacted in the Partnership Act is to a certain extent a
